This assessment is a simple hangman style game with a cake baking theme. *There are two different working files for this game. 'oIndex.html' and 'oGame.html' are the files where I had the game as an object.* The game takes the user's keyboard inputs as a way to progress through the game with any wrong inputs decreasing the amount of remaining guesses. When a letter is pressed if checks to see if the letter is in the current word that is being solved. If so, it then replaces all the blank spaces with the letter where they would appear in the word. Once the word has been correctly guessed a photo appears to show what the word was. At the end of the list of words, the final image is determined whether the user correctly guessed all of the words or not.
