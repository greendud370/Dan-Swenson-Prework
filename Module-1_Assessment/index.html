                        Hello! I know the picture of me is small but it is the most recent one I have of myself. I think it's pretty easy to see that I like to travel on a motorcyle. The current picture was went I went to Mohave National Preserve. Some other places I've been have been the Badlands, Death Valley, Glacier National Park, Canada, and even a small bit of Alaska.
                        <br> <br>
                        I have recently graduated St. Olaf College with degrees in both Physics and Math. I have always liked to figure out how the world works. I wasn't originally going to have a double major but that changed during college. The math degree came about after I studied abroad in Budapest with some friends. After that, we just kept taking more and more math classes together until we all had math degrees.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the things that made me pursue physics in the first place was fluid dynamics, but mainly water. This is probably due to how much time I spent in it as a kid. This usually entailed swimming and sailing, both of which I still do. I have been a competative swimmer for around 9 years now and still find the water fascinating. 
                        The sailing is something I enjoy with my cousins. We recently purchased a boat together that can fit all of us, so whenever we are at our grandmother's cabin we can sail all day.
